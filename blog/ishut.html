        <h1>Internet Shutdowns in India</h1>
        <p>
            India boasts a mobile internet penetration rate of more than 50%, making it the world's 
            second-largest in terms of mobile internet subscribers. With over 100 crore users, mobile internet 
            bridges the communication gap among citizens. During COVID-19, mobile internet usage surged as most 
            services, including education, governance, and payments, relied on digital infrastructure. The internet 
            has thus become a basic necessity for humans, alongside traditional needs like <em>roti, kapda, makaan</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite its importance, mobile internet has faced several shutdowns due to religious, political, or 
            anti-government agitations. Internet shutdowns have evolved alongside the growth of mobile internet and 
            its penetration. While it is a medium to share relevant information, it can also spread misinformation 
            on a large scale, potentially disrupting state law and order. To prevent such scenarios, law enforcement 
            agencies often resort to temporarily banning mobile internet.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            While shutdowns help maintain law and order, they significantly disrupt the digital public infrastructure 
            (DPI). For instance, the UPI-based payment system, which processes transactions close to â‚¹1 lakh crore daily, 
            is heavily impacted. This affects both customers and retailers who rely on cashless transactions, thereby 
            disrupting businesses. Additionally, shutdowns curtail freedom of expression and deny access to authentic 
            information amidst misinformation.
        </p>
        <h2>Possible Solutions</h2>
        <p>
            To mitigate the impact of internet shutdowns, the following solutions are proposed:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Short-Term Solution:</strong> Implement a segmented approach by telecom providers to ensure 
                essential services are accessible even during a shutdown. This can be achieved using network slicing, 
                which creates isolated virtual networks on a shared physical network. Application-specific slices 
                would allow uninterrupted access to critical services like banking, healthcare, and e-commerce.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Medium-Term Solution:</strong> Ensure the correct flow of information by introducing minimal, 
                non-invasive policy changes for group chats. While challenging, this approach could help curb the spread 
                of misinformation.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Long-Term Solution:</strong> Promote digital literacy and include information verification as a 
                fundamental module. By empowering users to verify information independently, privacy concerns can be 
                addressed, and individuals can make informed decisions.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These solutions aim to balance the need for maintaining law and order while minimizing the disruption to 
            essential services and preserving digital rights.
